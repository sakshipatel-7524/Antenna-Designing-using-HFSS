# Antenna-Designing-using-HFSS
As part of my college project, I designed and simulated an antenna using ANSYS software. This antenna is a replica of the one described in a research paper from IIT Kharagpur, authored by Manisha Kahar and Mrinal Kanti Mandal from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. The paper is titled "A Slotted Circular Patch Antenna with Wideband Filtering Characteristics."

The project involved the following steps:

Literature Review: I began by thoroughly reviewing the research paper to understand the design principles, objectives, and specifications of the slotted circular patch antenna.

Design Implementation: Using ANSYS software, I recreated the antenna design as described in the paper. This involved defining the geometry of the slotted circular patch, setting up the appropriate boundary conditions, and selecting the right materials.

Simulation Setup: I configured the simulation parameters to analyze the antenna's performance. This included setting up the frequency range, mesh generation, and defining the excitation sources.

Analysis: After running the simulations, I analyzed the results to evaluate the antenna's performance characteristics, such as return loss, bandwidth, gain, and radiation patterns.

Comparison with Research Findings: I compared my simulation results with the findings reported in the research paper to ensure accuracy and validate the design.

Documentation: I documented the entire process, including design steps, simulation setup, results, and analysis. This comprehensive report served as a valuable resource for understanding the practical implementation of theoretical concepts.

This project provided hands-on experience in antenna design and simulation, reinforcing my understanding of electromagnetic theory and the practical applications of advanced engineering software like ANSYS.
